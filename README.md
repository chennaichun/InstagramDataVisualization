### Project

**Data Analysis for Andorra**  
This repository contains part of the visualization code used in research on leveraging social media data for urban design decision-making. The visualization focuses on analyzing and mapping sentiment data from user-generated content.

## Overview

The visualization code supports the findings of the research paper:  
**"Urban Data Mining with Natural Language Processing: Social Media as a Complementary Tool for Urban Design Decision Making"**  
Available at: [MIT DSpace](https://dspace.mit.edu/handle/1721.1/106414)

### Research Context

This project explores how big data and **Natural Language Processing (NLP)** can complement traditional methods for urban design and planning. By mining user-generated content such as reviews and sentiment data, the project identifies urban issues (e.g., parking shortages, traffic congestion) and opportunities for improvement.

### Key Features

- **Sentiment Maps**: Interactive visualizations showing positive and negative review clusters.
- **Heatmaps**: Highlights popular areas based on review data.
- **Multilingual Analysis**: Provides insights into visitor demographics based on review languages.
