## Project Description

An interactive dashboard designed to help users better understand public discussions about Andorra.  
This repository focuses on visualizing sentiment data to support research in urban planning and design.

## Overview

This code supports the research paper:  
**"Urban Data Mining with Natural Language Processing: Social Media as a Complementary Tool for Urban Design Decision-Making"**  
Available on [MIT DSpace](https://dspace.mit.edu/handle/1721.1/106414).

### Research Context

The project explores how **big data** and **Natural Language Processing (NLP)** can complement traditional urban planning methods. By mining user-generated content (e.g., social media posts and reviews), the research identifies urban challenges (e.g., parking shortages, traffic congestion) and opportunities for improvement.

### Key Features

- **Sentiment Maps**: Interactive visualizations of positive and negative sentiment clusters.
- **Heatmaps**: Highlight popular areas based on user-generated content.
- **Multilingual Analysis**: Insights into visitor demographics based on review languages.
- **Data-Driven Insights**: Reveals urban trends and public concerns using sentiment analysis.

## Installation

To run the visualization code:
1. Clone this repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/chennaichun/InstagramDataVisualization.git
