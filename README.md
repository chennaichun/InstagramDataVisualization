# Instagram Data Visualization

This repository contains part of the visualization code used in the research paper **"Urban Data Mining with Natural Language Processing: Social Media as a Complementary Tool for Urban Design Decision Making"** by Nai Chun Chen, Marrisa Stephens, Takehiko Nagakura, and Kent Larson.

## Overview

The visualization in this repository focuses on mapping sentiment analysis results from social media data. This was achieved by analyzing reviews and sentiments associated with various urban features in Andorra, such as tourist attractions, parking availability, and public transportation. The results were visualized as heatmaps and interactive maps to support urban design decision-making.

## Key Features

- **Interactive Sentiment Maps:** Highlights regions with positive or negative reviews.
- **Heatmaps of Popularity:** Displays the popularity of different areas based on user reviews.
- **Language-Based Analysis:** Provides insights into visitor demographics through multilingual review analysis.

## Research Context

This project is a part of a broader effort to leverage **Natural Language Processing (NLP)** and **social media mining** to uncover urban patterns and provide actionable insights for city planners and designers. By integrating user-generated data from platforms like TripAdvisor, the research demonstrates how big data can complement traditional urban survey methods.

## Installation
